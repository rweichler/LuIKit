# Project Goals:

* Make UIKit easier to use and deploy than JavaScript and Garry's Mod. The UIKit framework was extremely well-designed by Apple, using better abstractions could make it easy to use for anybody.
* This is **NOT** for vanilla iOS development. Make it cross platform. Now that [WinObjC](http://github.com/microsoft/WinObjC) is under development we need not worry about UIKit becoming abandoned.
* Do not use C or Objective C unless you absolutely *have* to. Only reserved for the most low-level bindings.
* Add easy hooking support for [substitute](http://github.com/comex/substitute) plugins
